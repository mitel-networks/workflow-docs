## Integrations

Integrations help connect you to third party solutions. They simply the act of doing an api integration directly with these vendors by using our drag and drop designer. Connecting to a third party service typically involves 2 pieces to the setup 1- Allowing permissions on the third party product side and creating keys or connection credentials (typically requires administrator credentials) 2 - Setting up the integration connection in workflow studio to use this information.

All integations start the same way using the following steps. After this read the instructions for each vendors specific connection steps.

- Click add to add a new integration and select from the catalog
- Complete the setup by entering in the vendors specific credential information
