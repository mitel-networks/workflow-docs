## Twilio

Note the information below comes primarily from the third party vendor. Website links / wording and steps may change without notice. 

Connections to twilio are managed through HTTP Basic authentication like other REST APIs provided by Twilio. In short, you will use your Twilio account SID as the username and your auth token as the password for HTTP Basic authentication.

[Twilio autentication docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/credentials/api#authentication){:target="_blank"}

These credentials are typically located on your main twilio dashboard after you login
