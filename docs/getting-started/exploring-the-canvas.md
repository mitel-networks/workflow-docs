## Exploring the canvas

When creating or editing a flow, the canvas is the area of the screen that allows you to add one Trigger followed by multiple actions that defines what the flow is going to do once it is triggered.

When creating a new flow, a Select Trigger option box will be displayed. This allows you to define how you would like the flow to be triggered. Each flow must contain one and only one trigger.
